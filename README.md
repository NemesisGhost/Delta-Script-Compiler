# Delta Script Compiler
This is a T-SQL script "compiler".  There are 3 objectives this project is trying to accomplish.
* Compile all of the SQL delta/change scripts from a set of files into 1 file
* Put the updates to each table into a separate file
* Check that each script contains the elements as required by our DBAs
